Today, besides this website, Intermix Version 0.5.0 was released.

The API was completely rewritten to be more intuitive. It now uses
a message-based, OSC-like format. It has lots of other improvements
that you can read about in the [Changelog](docs/CHANGELOG).
The development model was also changed to get new versions rolled out faster.
