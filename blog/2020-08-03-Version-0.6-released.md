Intermix Version v0.6.0 introduces preset management for plugins.

Plugins can save and restore properties defined in the
plugins action definitions. A preset can be stored directly by name
or in a preset "slot". Technically there is no need for using slots
but it can be more convenient for users to handle presets like they
are used to in desktop audio systems.

Saving and loading the plugin state as a preset is as simple as calling an
action creator:

```
<plugin>.actionCreators.savePreset("myPreset");
<plugin>.actionCreators.loadPreset("myPreset");
```

Slots don't save or load presets directly. They just store a preset name
that was saved before:

```
<plugin>.actionCreators.presetSlotNumber(0);        // arm slot number 0
<plugin>.actionCreators.presetSlotName("myPreset"); // write to slot

<plugin>.actionCreators.savePreset("myOtherPreset");
<plugin>.actionCreators.presetSlotNumber(5);
<plugin>.actionCreators.presetSlotName("myOtherPreset");
```

Now you have two presets and references to them in slot 0 and 5.
To "load" a preset from a slot you have to retrieve its name
and load the preset with this information:

```
const pluginState = store.getState()[<plugin ID>]; // get current state of a plugin
const presetName = pluginState.presetSlots[0];     // get the name stored in slot 0
<plugin>.actionCreators.loadPreset(presetName);    // finally load the preset
```

Besides this, plugin ID placeholder were renamed from _{UID}_ to _&lt;UID&gt;_
since curly braces have a meaning in OSC semantics. Other small changes are listed in the [Changelog](/docs/CHANGELOG).
