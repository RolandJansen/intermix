Intermix Version 0.6.0 introduces preset management for plugins.

Plugins can save and restore properties defined in their
action definitions. These property collections are called presets.
A preset can be stored directly by name
or in a so called slot. Technically there is no need for slots
but it could be convenient to handle presets in a similar way like in classic digital audio gear.

Saving and loading presets is as simple as calling an
action creator (in the examples we use a fictional plugin called _synth_):

```javascript
synth.actionCreators.savePreset("myPreset");
synth.actionCreators.loadPreset("myPreset");
```

Slots don't save or load presets directly. They just store a preset name
that was saved before:

```javascript
synth.actionCreators.presetSlotNumber(1);        // arm slot number 1
synth.actionCreators.presetSlotName("myPreset"); // write plugin-name to slot

synth.actionCreators.savePreset("myOtherPreset");
synth.actionCreators.presetSlotNumber(5);
synth.actionCreators.presetSlotName("myOtherPreset");
```

Now we have preset-references in slot 1 and 5.
To "load" one of these presets we have to retrieve its name
and then load the preset like in the first example:

```javascript
const state = intermix.getState()[synth.uid]; // get current state of the plugin
const presetName = state.presetSlots[5];      // get the name stored in slot 5
synth.actionCreators.loadPreset(presetName);  // finally load the preset
```

Another noticable change in 0.6.0 is that ID placeholders were renamed from `{UID}` to `<UID>`
since curly braces have a meaning in OSC semantics. Other small changes are listed in the [Changelog](/docs/CHANGELOG).
