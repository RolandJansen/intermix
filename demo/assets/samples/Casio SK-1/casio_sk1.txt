Attention all old-school electron-heads:

This is a small sample collection showcasing the simple analogue drum
sounds from that loveable lil' sound toy, the Casio SK-1 Sampler.

All sounds are normalized to 0dB in 44.1 KHz, 16 bit Mono, Windows WAV
format. Some noise reduction was used to eliminate a very slight 60Hz
hum caused by the power supply used.


The files included in this ZIP file are:


   1)skclhat.wav   (closed hi-hat)   
   2)skophat.wav   (open hi-hat)
   3)skkick.wav    (kick drum)
   4)sksnare.wav   (snare drum)
   5)skhitom.wav   (high toms)
   6)sklotom.wav   (low toms)
   7)skloop.wav    (factory "Disco" rhythm preset) 
   8)casio_sk1.txt (This text file)

    These samples are not for sale. You can use them freely for whatever
you like. If you write any music with these samples, feel free to
mention my name and the sample collection in the credits. You can even
send me a copy of the song in wav, Real Audio or MPEG Layer III format
if you like. Whatever you do, just have fun with 'em! ;)
